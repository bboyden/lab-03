</h2>
<p>
  In this lab, I took some older JavaScript code and gave it like a total glow-up. I refactored stuff using arrow functions, destructuring, and all that modern syntax goodness. I also got to mess with for..in and for..of loops, which honestly helped me understand objects and arrays way better. Then I made a module and exported it with <code>module.exports</code> and used <code>require</code> to bring it back in, which was pretty satisfying. Oh and I finally used the spread operator and it made things feel very smooth.
